# EnergyMixEmission
Uncover trends in renewable energy growth from 1970 onwards and assess its relationship with greenhouse gas emissions

The **world’s energy demand** continues to rise, while the **environmental impacts** follow a linear trend. In fact, the oil crisis in 70 century led US, Europe, and other regions to find a replacement for their energy sources. In an effort to meet this **growing demand** while **reducing emissions**, countries are investing heavily in **renewable energy** generation. It remains a learning curve, one that is still ongoing and continuously developing. 

### **-Kyoto Protocol ([1997](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol))-**

The Kyoto Protocol is an International treaty under the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change) (UNFCC) adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. The protocol aimed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally to combat climate change. link

### **-Paris Agreement ([2015](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement))-**

The Paris Agreement was adopted by 195 parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015. It is legally binding treaty on climate change with a commitment to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.”

Beyond these international agreements, the most economically efficient strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to [Kenneth Gillingham and James H. Stock](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257%2Fjep.32.4.53), is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to lower them to the point where the marginal benefits of reduction equal the marginal costs.

***So, is it truly worthwhile to invest in developing renewable energy and transitioning away from conventional energy sources?***

### -Objectives-

To uncover trends in renewable energy growth from 1970 onwards and assess its relationship with greenhouse gas emissions, providing insights into how energy transition productivity has influenced emission outcomes over time.
